FinalFantasyPython

This is a text based game that is inspired by the Final Fantasy series, particularly Final Fantasy 7 which is my favuorite. I decided to take the general idea of the battle system and code my own version of it from scratch. 

Any advice I've been given about becoming a better programmer usually involves people telling me to code something that I want to, so the idea of Final Fantasy *insert language name* was born. I believe that the more this project grows, the more problems I will run in to and the more I will learn about whatever language I'm coding the game in.
